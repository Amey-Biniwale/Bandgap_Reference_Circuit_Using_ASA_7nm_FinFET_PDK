## Scaling Beyond CMOS: FinFET Devices and Innovations
### Evolution of Integrated Circuits
In the beginning, around World War 2, Alan Turing and his colleagues invented an application-specific mechanical machine called Bombe to break the engima code. This laid the foundation for Integrated Circuits. In the post war era, inventions such as the ENIAC and EDVAC were invented for large-scale simulations. These machines used vaccum tubes to carry out the simulations. The drawback for these kind of machines was its size, as it stretched from the floor to ceiling and occupied entire rooms. Looking at the modern systems, we can fit the entire ENIAC machine on a chip sightly bigger than a coin. The next-generation chips will be tackling problems such as weather modelling and forecasting, health and precision medicine, virtual particle accelerator and many more.

### Microprocessor Trend
If we look at the data from the past 50 years, we can see that the Moore's Law still stands as the number of transistors on a chip are doubling every 18-20 months. Even though the transistors are doubling, the performance of the chips have started to saturate. This saturation is due to our inability to cool down the systems at a faster rate. This leads to saturation in power and frequency of the chips. Among all this, we can see that the number of cores on a chip is gradually increasing. These advancements took place as a result of iPhone being released. The mobile industry bought along numerous mobile applications which resulted in increase in number of cores.

For solving larger and larger problems, we will see a shift from indiviual devices to data-centre scale computing. In a data-centre, racks will be used as a socket. A rack contains many computing elements. In this scale, we use flop(floating point operations per second) to measure its performance. Currently, we have attained 8-10 Exaflop performance. The trend suggests that the flop performance doubles every 2 years. But, with increase in flops, the system demands more power.

The evolution of CMOS circuits is travelling towards 1nm technology node. The given image shows the roadmap of CMOS evolution. The Moore's Law has been essential to the semiconducter industry, but as the dimension of the devices reduces, simple lithography shrinks have become more challenging. To overcome this shortcomings,research is being conducted in several areas such as chennel materials, patterning methods, etc.
New channel materials such as Germanium, SiGe, and 2D materials such as MoS2 are being developed to replace conventional materials like Si and Ge. Moreover, patterning techniques like EUV, High-NA EUV have been reseached to increase the number of transistors on a chip. There also have been advancements in inteconnection material, gate stack material as well as the device structure which looks into various structures such as MBC-FET(Multi-Bridge Channel FET), 3DS-FET(3D Stacked FETs) and many more.
## Fin-FETs
A FinFET is a type of Field Effect Transistor which uses thin, fin-like silicon body that protrudes vertically from the substrate instead of a planar design. The gate wraps around the fin which gives it better control over the channel.

FinFETs usually use 22nm or less technology node. In planar structure FETs, there was a possibility of sub-channel leakages, but if we include a gate on both sides of the channel, the sub-channel leakage diminishes. Two gates also enhances the gate capacitance as well as the short-channel performance. Also, the FinFET offer near to ideal sub-threshold swing.
